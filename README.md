Just Another Silly Ufo Game ..... Enjoy!
# Motivation
After looking at some students' exercises, I decided to make this little game
to spend quickly my time.
# Technology used
This software was built with Java SE 7, Swing and Eclipse as an IDE.
# Running this software
In order to run this software, Java must be installed on your computer.
Main class is Ufoshooting.java. 
You must also contain the .jpg of ufo,player and bullet to load when the game starts.
# Use of this software
Aim of the game is to score as much points as you can by shooting the flying saucer.

Rules of the game:
 - Use arrow keys to move Left-Right and Space to shoot bullets.
 - Every saucer, appears randomly on screen.
 - There is a wait time for the saucer to stay there. Time when the game starts is 3000ms (3 secs).
 - After 5 causers have been shot down, wait time reduces 20%.
 - If you miss to shut down 5 saucers in sequence, you lose!
 
 High score is saved in a file called "ufoscore.txt". Everytime a new game is loaded, hiscore will
 be displayed.
